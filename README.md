# Customer_Segmentation Analysis
Customer Segmentation Analysis Project

# Introduction
Customer Segmentation is the process of division of customer base into several groups of individuals that share a similarity in different ways that are relevant to marketing such as gender, age, interests, and miscellaneous spending habits. Companies that deploy customer segmentation are under the notion that every customer has different requirements and require a specific marketing effort to address them appropriately.

Companies aim to gain a deeper approach of the customer they are targeting. Therefore, their aim has to be specific and should be tailored to address the requirements of each and every individual customer. Furthermore, through the data collected, companies can gain a deeper understanding of customer preferences as well as the requirements for discovering valuable segments that would reap them maximum profit. This way, they can strategize their marketing techniques more efficiently and minimize the possibility of risk to their investment. The technique of customer segmentation is dependent on several key differentiators that divide customers into groups to be targeted.

Data related to demographics, geography, economic status as well as behavioral patterns play a crucial role in determining the company direction towards addressing the various segments.

# Customer Gender Visualization:

In this project , I created a barplot and a piechart to show the gender distribution across the customer_data dataset. A bar chart represents data in rectangular bars with length of the bar proportional to the value of the variable. R uses the function barplot() to create bar charts. R can draw both vertical and Horizontal bars in the bar chart. In bar chart each of the bars can be given different colors.

# Algorithms:

While using the k-means clustering algorithm, the first step is to indicate the number of clusters (k) that I need to produce in the final output. The algorithm starts by selecting k objects from dataset randomly that will serve as the initial centers for our clusters. These selected objects are the cluster means, also known as centroids. Then, the remaining objects have an assignment of the closest centroid. This centroid is defined by the Euclidean Distance present between the object and the cluster mean. This  step is referred as “cluster assignment”.

A line chart or line plot or line graph or curve chart is a type of chart which displays information as a series of data points called 'markers' connected by straight line segments. It is a basic type of chart common in many fields. Used across many fields, this type of graph can be quite helpful in depicting the changes in values over time. For depicting the line plot the package,ggplot is used.
